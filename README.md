# Discord.JS Bot base

The base I use to make Discord Bots.

This is kind of a "framework" I made to develop my bots. It provides advanced command handler and module system.
The main feature is the fact that everything can be added/modified/removed, such as command files or modules, without
stopping the process, with only a reload command.
